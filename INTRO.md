Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes... the ones who see things differently -- they're not fond of rules... You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things...

We are not Steve Jobs ;-) We just think it's a cool name for a really trusted SR. No Scam-bullshit...
We think we need more people like him. Good people with incredible ideas. His philosophy in our present age. We combine Blockchain with something totally crazy. Something that has never been before. 

Please support us and Votet for us! All the money goes into the project. Therefore no Rewards. Hmmm and....why you should Vote for us? Good Question:

We think that Rewards can help an SR to push its projects extrem forward. We as SR need to work for the ecosystem and bring Tron to the front. We can create a Project without an ICO...only our Trust is necessary.

What is your Idea? That depends on how many people would support us. 
- Planning 1 year. 
- 1.5 years prototype development. 
- Production costs 600K. 
- No app! 
ItÂ´s something big. Something that can change the world ... how we live... how we think ... how we work ... - just everything! ...
